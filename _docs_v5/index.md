This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to OpenC3. We'll cover topics such
as getting your configuration up and running, developing test and operations scripts,
building custom telemetry screens, and give you some advice on participating in the future
development of OpenC3 itself.

## So what is OpenC3, exactly?

OpenC3 is a suite of applications that can be used to control a set of embedded systems. These systems can be
anything from test equipment (power supplies, oscilloscopes, switched power strips, UPS devices, etc), to
development boards (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, etc), to satellites.

### OpenC3 Architecture

![OpenC3 Architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/img/v5/architecture.png)

OpenC3 5 is a cloud native, containerized, microservice oriented command and control system. All the OpenC3 microservices are docker containers which is why Docker is shown containing the entire OpenC3 system. The green boxes on the left represent external embedded systems (Targets) which OpenC3 connects to. The Redis data store contains the configuration for all the microservices, the current value table, as well as data streams containing decommutated data. The Minio data store contains plugins, targets, configuration data, text logs as well as binary logs of all the raw, decommutated, and reduced data. Users interact with OpenC3 from a web browser which routes through the internal Traefik load balancer.
